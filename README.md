# Tidy-hands
## Welcome to Tidy-hands, a project built to enhance my learning in React, Redux, and Restful API. This project also utilizes Vercel serverless functions and Mongoose/MongoDB.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies.

Next, you will need to install the Vercel CLI. Once installed, run `vercel dev` to start the development server.

That's it! You should now be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000.

Happy coding!
